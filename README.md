# mean-std-var-calculator
A calculator that calculates the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened input matrix using numpy.

This calculator project uses basic **numpy** mathematical functions in calculating the fundamental statistics of a list of 9 numbers. The calculator takes the nine digits and transforms it into a 3x3 numpy array. Then, it calculates the **mean**. **variance**, **standard deviation**, **max**, **min**, and **sum** along both axes and its flattened array. This code also utilizes the basics of handling **dictionaries** in outputting the calculations.

The *mean_var_std.py* contains the **calculate** function that does the statistical calculations. The *main.py* runs the *mean_var_std.py* code while also testing the calculator using the *test_module.py*. This python code uses the **unittest** module to test the calculator on multiple cases of user input.


*This code requires numpy version 1.18.5 to run*
